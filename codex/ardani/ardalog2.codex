    "Our first charge cycle is nearly complete, warp-1 will take place in under 24 hours now. This drive is touted to have a warp success rate of 99.36%, and an estimated catastrophic failure rate of 0.29%. With 18 scheduled jumps that gives us a 94.9% of not being blasted into molecules, and 89.1% chance that every jump is successful. Every single person onboard is thinking about those numbers right now. As for that 5.8% in-between best and worst case outcomes ... no one really knows what happens in there."
